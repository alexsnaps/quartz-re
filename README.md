# Quartz Scheduler for Rust

Port of the original [Quartz Scheduler](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/) from 
[Java](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz) to Rust.

## Status

Work in progress, I'll update this section regularly... 

## About

I worked on the Java version of the Quartz Scheduler in a previous life. I already liked it as a user for its 
simplicity and enjoyed it even more for the exact same reason when I started extending it at Terracotta. I hope to 
bring the same joy to Rust developers looking for an easy to use and reliable scheduler.
